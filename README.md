# springboot-learning
This repository contains the projects and code samples I created while learning Java backend development with Spring Boot. Throughout this journey, I explored core concepts of the Spring Framework, including Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and the MVC architecture using Spring MVC. I built RESTful web services using @RestController, along with various HTTP method annotations such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, and others. For handling JSON data, I used the Jackson library for serialization and deserialization. I also worked with the H2 in-memory database to build and test applications quickly without requiring external database setup. To manage data persistence, I used JPA with Hibernate, learning how to define entities, perform CRUD operations, and understand the differences between lazy and eager loading. Additionally, I incorporated Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and improve readability using annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @Builder, and @Slf4j. Overall, this repository showcases the foundational skills and practical experience I've gained in building modern, efficient Java backend applications using Spring Boot and related technologies.
